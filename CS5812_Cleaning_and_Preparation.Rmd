### The scatterplots show huge variation in in temparatures over the year with similarities for monthly weather and slight variations in maximum temperature which seems to be an outlier. We can also see similar patterns for visibility for a few months where it changes seasonally and has a particular pattern.

###From above correlations we can see that there is correlation between delay in departure of flights and carrier delay. Also delay in security has a very strong impact on departures and causing delays.
