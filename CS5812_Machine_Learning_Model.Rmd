# **Machine Learning Prediction**

The dataset was loaded into the rmd file - with some basic statistical analysis being carried out. 

```{r}
# Loading the integrated dataset
delayed_flights <- read.csv("Delay_Flight_Airport_Visibility.csv")

# Visualising the dataset
View(delayed_flights)

# Visualising the structure of the dataset
str(delayed_flights)

# Visualising the dimensions of the dataset
dim(delayed_flights)

# Visualising the summary of the dataset
summary(delayed_flights)

# Visualising the attribute/column names of the dataset
names(delayed_flights)

# Visualising the first six rows of the dataset
head(delayed_flights)

# Visualising the last six rows of the dataset 
tail(delayed_flights)
```

Trying to build a regression model to determine what the ouput of this would be.

```{r}
# Building a linear regression model using all of the attributes in the dataset
delayMaxModel <- lm(DepDelay ~ DayofMonth + DayOfWeek + DepTime + ArrTime + CRSElapsedTime + AirTime + Origin.City + Destination.City + AirTime + visibility + Distance +  + UniqueCarrier, data=delayed_flights)

# Building a linear regression model using all of the attributes affecting departure delay from the dataset
delayMaxModel <- lm(DepDelay ~ AirTime + Origin.City + Destination.City + visibility + Distance + UniqueCarrier, data=delayed_flights)

# Sumamrising the model that was built
summary(delayMaxModel)

# Using the ‘step’ function can be used to achieve a minimal adequate model.
step(delayMaxModel)
```

Visualising numeric attributes of the dataset.

```{r}
# Creating a subset of numeric attributes
delayed_flights_numeric <- delayed_flights[,sapply(delayed_flights, is.numeric)]

# Visualising the correlation between the attributes
cor(delayed_flights_numeric)
```

## **Random Forest**

Building an ensemble learning model using Random Forest. The different models contained different parameters and hyperparameters (including architectures).

- Classifying delays into two sets of groups (i.e. into 2 and 3 categories)
- Classifying delays by using two sets of attributes 
- Classifying delays by using three different numbers of trees

## Classifying delays into two sets of groups: **Short Delay and Long Delay**

```{r}
# Creating new column (Delayed Departure) with two types of delayed groups
delayed_flights$DelayedDeparture <- ifelse((delayed_flights$DepDelay <= 45), 'Short Delay', 'Long Delay')

# Visualising new column (Delayed Departure)
table(delayed_flights$DelayedDeparture)

# Converting data type of new column (Delayed Departure) to a factor
delayed_flights$DelayedDeparture <- as.factor(delayed_flights$DelayedDeparture)
```

## Classifying delays into two sets of groups: **AirTime, Visibility, Distance, Origin.City, and UniqueCarrier**

```{r}
# Defining the formula for predicting Delayed Departure
delayed_flights_formula = DelayedDeparture ~ AirTime + visibility + Distance + Origin.City + UniqueCarrier

# Defining the formula for predicting Delayed Departure
delayed_flights_formula = DelayedDeparture ~ AirTime + Origin.City + Destination.City + visibility + Distance + UniqueCarrier
```

```{r}
# Setting random seed to make the implementation repeatable
set.seed(1999)

# Creating a 70/30 training/test set split
n_rows <- nrow(delayed_flights)

# Sampling 70% (n_rows * 0.7) indices in the ranges 1:nrows
training_idx <- sample(n_rows, n_rows * 0.7)

# Filtering the data frame with the training indices (and the complement)
training_delayed_flights <- delayed_flights[training_idx,]
test_delayed_flights <- delayed_flights[-training_idx,]
```

## Classifying delays by using three different numbers of trees: **50 trees**

```{r}
# Train a model with random forest - using 50 trees
rf_delayed_flights <- randomForest(as.factor(DelayedDeparture) ~ AirTime + Origin.City + Destination.City + visibility + Distance + UniqueCarrier, ntree = 50, importance = T, data = training_delayed_flights)
```

```{r}
# Plotting error rates of random forest model
plot(rf_delayed_flights, main="Random Forest Error Rates")

# Plotting importance of attributes (from the random forest model built)
varImpPlot(rf_delayed_flights, type = 1, main="Random Forest Attribute Importance")
```

```{r}
# Predicting (classifying) the 'departure delay' by removing delay attribute from the testing set
rf_delayed_flights_pred <- predict(rf_delayed_flights, test_delayed_flights [,-47], type= "class")

# Creating a contingency table for the actual and predicted for the random forest model
rf_results_table <- table(rf = rf_delayed_flights_pred,  actual = test_delayed_flights$DelayedDeparture)

# Visualising the contingency table created
rf_results_table

# Calculating the accuracy of the random forest model using the contigency table
acc_rf <- sum(diag(rf_results_table)) / sum(rf_results_table)

# Visualising the accuracy of the random forest model
acc_rf*100
```

## Classifying delays by using three different numbers of trees: **100 trees**

```{r}
# Train a model with random forest - using 100 trees
rf_delayed_flights <- randomForest(as.factor(DelayedDeparture) ~ AirTime + Origin.City + Destination.City + visibility + Distance + UniqueCarrier, ntree = 100, importance = T, data = training_delayed_flights)
```

```{r}
# Plotting error rates of random forest model
plot(rf_delayed_flights, main="Random Forest Error Rates")

# Plotting importance of attributes (from the random forest model built)
varImpPlot(rf_delayed_flights, type = 1, main="Random Forest Attribute Importance")
```

```{r}
# Predicting (classifying) the 'departure delay' by removing delay attribute from the testing set
rf_delayed_flights_pred <- predict(rf_delayed_flights, test_delayed_flights [,-47], type= "class")

# Creating a contingency table for the actual and predicted for the random forest model
rf_results_table <- table(rf = rf_delayed_flights_pred,  actual = test_delayed_flights$DelayedDeparture)

# Visualising the contingency table created
rf_results_table

# Calculating the accuracy of the random forest model using the contigency table
acc_rf <- sum(diag(rf_results_table)) / sum(rf_results_table)

# Visualising the accuracy of the random forest model
acc_rf*100
```

## Classifying delays by using three different numbers of trees: **150 trees**

```{r}
# Train a model with random forest - using 150 trees
rf_delayed_flights <- randomForest(as.factor(DelayedDeparture) ~ AirTime + Origin.City + Destination.City + visibility + Distance + UniqueCarrier, ntree = 150, importance = T, data = training_delayed_flights)
```

```{r}
# Plotting error rates of random forest model

rf_results_table <- table(rf = rf_delayed_flights_pred,  actual = test_delayed_flights$DelayedDeparture)

# Visualising the contingency table created
rf_results_table

# Calculating the accuracy of the random forest model using the contigency table
acc_rf <- sum(diag(rf_results_table)) / sum(rf_results_table)
