# CS5812-Predictive-Data-Analysis
CS5812: Predictive Data Analysis Group Coursework

**Abstract**
The aim of the project is to use machine learning techniques – including deep learning techniques – to answer the  research question (i.e. make predictions) and discover new knowledge about flight delays within the US. To do this,  four datasets – some of which were transformed and/or reduced as deemed appropriate – were merged together  before carrying out data cleaning to remove any irregularities with the merged dataset. Exploratory data analysis was  carried out both on individual datasets – before the integration – as well as the combined dataset to develop an  understand about the data and to be able to inform the machine learning predictions that were to be carried out.  Upon having additional insights about the dataset, an ensemble model was built using machine learning techniques  and deep learning techniques. The performance of the different models was looked at – including comparing models  built using different machine learning and deep learning techniques. The report concludes with a discussion of the  findings from the project, the data management plan used, and an authorship contribution statement from the mem 
bers involved.
